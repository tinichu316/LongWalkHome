# Long Walk Home
##### A Game by William Wang
## How to Play
The game is built in WebGL and developed in part for the GDDC UofT Game Making Deathmatch game jam.

It is recommended to download the standalone version at https://tinichu.itch.io/long-walk-home for performance reasons.

Alternatively, go to https://tinichu316.github.io/ on a WebGL supported browser and click on the title Long Walk Home (2019). However, it may run slowly.

## Theme
In Long walk home, the goal is to make it home from your friend's late night party. Perhaps along the way you will discover some memories you have made with some close friends as well.

## Introduction
Long walk home is a first person atmospheric experience. You play as a young high school student who, after leaving a friend's house party late at night, must walk back home. Along the way, you may discover various objects and people to interact with that may end up changing your life forever.

## Current Development
Currently, the seaside town is quite bare. There are plans to expand and further add additional quests and interactable items within the town. As such, there are occasional barriers on the streets which indicate that the area past that is in development and there is currently nothing interesting.

## Inspiration
The starting inspiration for Long Walk Home was simply from walking home late at night. I wanted to recreate that calm, yet slightly spooky and mysterious city atmosphere. At night, the town can often look much different from the day. A core theme was to have the atmosphere be scary yet also calm - this was not a horror game. As such, there are no jumpscares nor were any decisions made to have you constantly feel pursued or chased. You are simply an explorer.

Many of the gameplay elements such as the time reset and the various quests were inspired by Outer Wilds, particularly in that sense of discovery and mystery that comes with exploring and eventually understanding the environment.

Some of the items and dialogue were inspired in part by games such as Earthbound and Undertale. I had tried to incorporate a sense of humour yet also discovery into the dialogue such that it would give the world some more life.

The town itself and the events and people in it are largely from either my own personal experience or from those that I have heard about. Often while creating this town, despite developing this new world from scratch, there was a sense of nostalgia in the different areas and dialogues that stems from this personal inspiration.

Lastly, inspiration was pulled from the movie Groundhog day. Both feature a repeating timeline that is not stopped until all of the various quests that have gone ignored are fulfilled.

## Development
One of the main challenges of developing an adventure game that captivates its audience by its content and exploration is the creation of many diverse, and interesting locations and things to do. Over time, I hope to further flesh out the world with more quests and things to explore, as well as to improve on the gameplay element such that there is greater compulsion to finish the game and complete all the quests.

The game itself was developed in C# using the Unity Engine over the course of a few weeks. Development itself was sparse, only a few hours a week, but continual. It was helpful to have an overarching plan and to have the city map sketched out so that future updates would focus on world expansion.

It was also good to develop the main gameplay systems before building the world so that any bugs would be minimal and additional features could be extensions rather than the essentials.

## Contributors
The game was solely developed by myself with aspects of inspiration from friends. Many of the assets were modelled in Unity using ProBuilder with the exception of various houses and shops. The terrain was created using L3DT.
